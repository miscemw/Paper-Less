# Aphantasia
People who can't visualise physical things in their minds.

If you close your eyes and picture an apple, how clear is that apple in your mind?

In people with aphantasia, it's like a fully functioning computer is turned on and working, but the screen is turned off.
# Aphantasia
Aphantasia is the inability to form mental images.

Many people live with aphantasia contentedly and productiviely. It can come on as a result of trauma or psychological episode, but most people wit aphantasia have it their whole lives.

President of Pixar Disney (recently retired) had it. Both left and right brain dominant people can have the condition. About 1% of the population is thought to have aphantasia, according to the researcher on the video. [Aphantasia.com](https://aphantasia.com/what-is-aphantasia/) says it's more like ~3–5%.

People with aphantasia often feel they can move on from difficult situations quite quickly. They still feel, they experience emotions, but it's a bit like out of sight out of mind. They have emotions, but don't create images to go with them. They show the expected response to being shown images, but can't recreate those images in their minds at a later time. 

The condition could provide some protection from PTSD. Many people experiencing aphantasia do not feel it is a disability, or a condition that they 'suffer' from.
