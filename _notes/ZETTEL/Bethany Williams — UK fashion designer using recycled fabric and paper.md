Bethany Williams — UK fashion designer using recycled fabric and paper

Bethany Williams is a designer in the UK who uses recycled paper, yarn, and fabric to create fashion items like clothing and bags.

There’s a lot of work involved in the process, as jeans and other clothing must first be cleaned and unpicked. From there they are printed with bold designs, and sewn into new styles. When sourcing the second hand clothing, they try to pick the largest waist lines possible, as these have the most fabric.

It’s estimated that only 12% of the material used to make clothing ends up recycled into another useful form, with most being incinerated or sent to landfill (often in a different country) when it’s no longer wanted. The current fabric industry is consumer driven, with little to no consideration for the environment.
