Rise above the clouds of doubt

>…just as the Savior came forth from His stone grave, may we awake from our spiritual slumber and rise above the clouds of doubt, the clutches of fear, the intoxication of pride, and the lull of complacency.
—Michael John U. Teh, Sunday AM session of the April 2021 General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
