# Pippa's Song
(From “Pippa Passes”)

The year's at the spring,
And day's at the morn;
Morning's at seven;
The hillside's dew-pearled;
The lark's on the wing;
The snail's on the thorn;
God's in His Heaven—
All's right with the world!

—ROBERT BROWNING


The last two lines of this poem are quoted by Anne in Anne of Green Gables by L. M. Montgomery, end of chapter 38.

**Pippa Passes**, verse drama in four parts by [Robert Browning](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Browning), published in 1841. The poem’s sections—Morning, Noon, Evening, and Night—are linked by episodes that either comment on the preceding scene or presage the scene to follow.

On New Year’s morning, her only holiday for the entire year, Pippa, an impoverished young silk-winder, sings as she wanders aimlessly. In each section of the poem, people who are at critical points in their lives make significant and far-reaching decisions when they hear Pippa sing as she passes by.
