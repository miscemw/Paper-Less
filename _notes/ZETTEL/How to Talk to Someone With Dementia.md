- Don't try to force them into your reality—go with them into theirs.
- Don't tell them they can't do things anymore. The issue isn't the mechanics of the task, it's comprehension and cognition. Choose your words carefully, and always acknowledge what they *can* do.
- Memory loss for the sufferer is similar to when we're driving and all of a sudden find ourselves in fog. We slow down, and don't know if we're in danger from behind or upfront. Some things we can make out, but we can't see the full picture, and it can be scary.
- Sufferers want to be emotionally safe. They don't want to fail, or have people say "*That*'s not right."
- Don't ask a person with short-term memory loss a short-term memory question. They know they're smart, and don't want to feel dumb because they can't answer what should be a simple question!
- Become aware of then learn to give up expectations you may have (may have always had) about that person. 
- Focus on their strengths. Don't let the loss of memory cause you to forget that they're still in there somewhere.

## I'M STILL IN HERE! Presentation slides
**Types of Memory**

### Functional
- Reasoning
- Comprehension
- Conscious

First to decline

How do I get from here to there and back again?
How do I operate this piece of machinery?
How can I make sense of the menu in a restaurant without being overwhelmed?
This is usually the first type of memory to be affected.

### Procedural
- "Automatic"
- No conscious control
- Tasks: eating, driving

Remains but less than
emotional

If you're worried about them still driving while experiencing cognitive issues, don't tell them "you can't drive anymore". That will proably meet with big resistance. Instead, tell them something like "well of course you can drive, there's no question of that, but you know I was out the other day on the road, when I had to make a split-second decision—it was scary!" Choose your words carefully, and always acknowledge that they still know how to drive. They still won't like it, but it'll probably go down better than telling them they can't do what they know they can.

### Emotional
- Unconscious
- Gut reaction
- Cued

Remains the longest

Brain wants to stay in control, so it concocts a story to help things make sense. Just like we do when we trip, blaming it on someone or something else.
