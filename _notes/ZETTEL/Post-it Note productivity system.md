Post-it Note productivity system

One task per Post-it note. Put the note on your laptop and work on that, and only that. When it's done, add it to your pile of completed tasks. Pick another task from your pile of tasks that need doing.  Levelsio loves the rush and the motivation he gets from seeing his growing pile of completed Post-it note tasks. It's a very portable system.

This system could work well alongside my plain text system. The ideal productivity system for me is one I can dip into and out of. It has to be simple enough that there's nothing to break.
