# Paco Cantero's tagging method

The golden question in planning is **When am I going to do this?**

Create batches, like—
1. Today
2. Tomorrow
3. This week
4. Next week
5. This month
6. Dead time (Ellane calls this Down time)

The workflow has you checking all the batches every day and moving items that need moving. Then simply focus on doing today's tasks, in order. That's it!

You manage time, not tasks. Life is an endless loop, and so is this technique.
