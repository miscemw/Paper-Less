# Word of Wisdom and Cola Drinks
There's plenty of verse-free official LDS reading to be done on the topic of addictive substances. I like this question from the Teachings of David O McKay, chapter 11: "What harmful and addictive substances are available today that are not specifically mentioned in D&C 89? How can the teachings in D&C 89 and the words of latter-day prophets help guide and strengthen us against these substances?" 

I'm not commenting on whether or not Coke is addictive for everyone, but for [[Cola drinks can be addictive|many people]] it has shown to be so. The Word of Wisdom is a marvellous opportunity to exercise wisdom as it pertains to our own body. I agree that it's time to stop the whole Coke-is-evil thing, but let's also be open to a higher way of thinking about the Word of Wisdom instead of justifying the stuff we like the taste of.
