# Children are to be instructed as is pleasing to God
And again, you shall…do the work of printing, and of selecting and writing books for schools…, that little children also may receive instruction before me as is pleasing unto me. D&C 55:4

Is there a message in this scripture not just specifically for Oliver Cowdrey and William W. Phelps, but also for us in our business endeavours? Do we still feel the call to produce uplifting educational materials?
