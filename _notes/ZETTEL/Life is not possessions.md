Life is not possessions

And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
KJV Luke 12:15

Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions. — Luke 12:15 (NIV)
