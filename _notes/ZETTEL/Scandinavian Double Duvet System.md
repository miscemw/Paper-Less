# Scandinavian Double Duvet System

In Scandinavia and Germany it's normal to find two quilts, or duvets, on a shared bed. They meet neatly in the middle when the bed is made (folded in half lengthwise), and often have a folded blanket or bed scarf across the end of the bed for a unifying look. 

When it's time to sleep, each person has their own cover. No matter how much one partner moves about, you stay warm and covered under a quilt that's the right weight for you. Life changing!

To adjust for the changing seasons, insert a warmer or cooler quilt into the cover. Layer quilts or blankets inside the cover, if you like, adding snaps around the edges to keep them in place.

Because here's no need for a top sheet (except on the hottest nights), bed making becomes a super simple one minute task. 

Wash the duvet cover every week, and the duvet itself every month or so to keep it fresh.

A lady in the US came up with this solution, not realising it'd already been done for years. Good insights from the comments.
