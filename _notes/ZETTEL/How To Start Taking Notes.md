# How To Start Taking Notes

When you realise you want to develop a note taking system, don’t try to set it up perfectly before you begin. Simply write down the thing you don’t want to forget in a fairly concise way, using the medium that makes the most sense to you at the time. Like a hermit crab outgrowing its shell, your system will tell you when it needs to expand and change. 

It’s fine to experiment with different ways to take notes, but don’t spread important information too widely across different input methods or you won’t be able to find what you need when you need it. One paper notebook, a type of [[Commonplace Book]], plus a collection of plain text files in a folder is a good place to start if you need more than one way to record things.

>If you don’t take notes but you want to start, I recommend you to think big, but start small. Start with creating a daily journal or work log. Make yourself comfortable with taking notes. Don’t try to develop your perfect note-taking system, because, on this step, you don’t even know what you need. Make yourself comfortable with taking notes first, and go to the next level if you’re ready. And don’t forget about your why – your future self may thank you someday.
