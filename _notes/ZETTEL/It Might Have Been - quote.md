For all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these, "It might have been".
John Greenleaf Whittier
from the poem "Maud Muller", about a beautiful young girl who meets a wealthy judge from the local town. Both are attracted to the other, but neither says anything. They each go on with their lives, wondering what might have been.

Alas for maiden, alas for Judge,
For rich repiner and household drudge!
God pity them both! and pity us all,
Who vainly the dreams of youth recall;
For all sad words of tongue and pen,
The saddest are these: "It might have been!"
