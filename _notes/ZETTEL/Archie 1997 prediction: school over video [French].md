Archie 1997 prediction: school over video [French]

In 1997, the comic book Archie predicted that kids in 2021 would be lucky enough to have school at home—no need to carry books or worry about getting places on time. Some commenters state that they did not predict the depression some students would feel as a result of this type of teaching.
