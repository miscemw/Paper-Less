Make your work the focus, with [[Obsidian MOC]] or whatever app you’re using, as merely a tool to help you get where you’re going. If you get bogged down tinkering with folder structures, tagging protocols and nice looking graphs, you might miss the real reason you’re using the tool—to produce quality content, to extend your thinking, to touch lives and bring good to the world.
