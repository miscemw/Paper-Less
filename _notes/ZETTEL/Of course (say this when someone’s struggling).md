# Don't be neutral; say "Of course."

Ashley Abramson wrote about this suggestion from therapist Lindsay Braman on Medium.

Braman says that your neutrality can increase a struggling person’s suffering, whereas saying “Of course,” suggests that you’d feel that way too in their position—thus lightening the load.

Saying "Of course you feel [x]," gives them permission to feel big feelings, making it more likely they'll be able to regulate those feelings.

"Neutrality on the part of a listener makes shame grow bigger," Braman wrote.

>Kids with caregivers who give them _permission_ to feel big feelings and _support_ in managing those feelings are kids with tools to able to become adults who can regulate emotions and find resiliency in the face of crisis.
