Window management apps
#Mac

**Moom** $14.99 AU / $9.99 US
Too complicated, which would be fine except that it doesn’t sync between devices. This would be my app of choice if I only used one device.

**Magnet** $ AU 12.99 / $7.99 US
Very good. Simple enough that sync isn’t needed. I don’t often miss the added functionality of Moom.

**Rectangle** Open source = free
Does everything Magnet can do except the thirds options.
