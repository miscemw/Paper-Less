# Love the Lord or you will fall

>"I believe this is the greatest lesson that can be learned by the youth of Zion - to do the right thing because you love the Lord. It is so vitally important that, I feel, if you do anything in righteousness for any other reason than you love the Lord, you are wrong - at least you are on very shaky ground. And, somewhere your reasons for acting in righteousness will not be strong enough to see you through. You will give way to expediency, or peer group pressure, or honour, or fame, or applause, or the thrill of the moment, or some other worldly reason. Unless your motives are built upon the firm foundation of love of the Lord, you will not be able to stand.”
—Hartman Rector, Jnr, Live above the Law to Be Free, Ensign, Jan. 1973, p. 30
