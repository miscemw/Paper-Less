Author Gretchen Rubin on how to rebound from a mistake:

>Instead of feeling that you’ve blown the day and thinking, "I'll get back on track tomorrow," try thinking of each day as a set of four quarters: **morning**, **midday**, **afternoon**, **evening**. 
>If you blow one quarter, you get back on track for the next quarter. 
>
>Fail small, not big.
