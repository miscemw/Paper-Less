# Drafts

Drafts is the app I turn to first when it's time to write down something I want to remember at a later time. I choose the items that sit in my iPhone dock very carefully
In brief, Drafts allows me to quickly enter text without having to first decide where it should end up. Once I know where I want the text to go, it's a simple matter of invoking one of the customisable actions to send it there. Most things end up in my PLAIN TEXT folder, either as separate .txt files, or appended/prepended to an existing file (eg. Monthly journal, or Movies I have watched).

Drafts is the most useful app on my mobile devices, when it comes to text entry of any kind. The iPhone dock only has room for 4 apps, so these tend to be a good indication of priorities. Mine are Phone, Messages, Drafts, Email (Spark).
