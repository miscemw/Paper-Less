"You get the vibe; something gets in your way, you just eat it. The job's not done till it's done"
~ Elder Caleb Weedon

If you've got the vibe and something gets in your way, you just eat it. The job's not done till it's done.

Caleb often tells us there are no excuses for not doing what needs to be done. It won't get any easier than it is right now, so why not start? Don't let anything get in your way of the destination at the other end of this task.
