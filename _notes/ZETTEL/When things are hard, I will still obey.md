# When things are hard, I will still obey

This is why I told my children I would keep my covenants even if it meant letting earthly harm come to them, or someone else, as a result. 

If someone threatened to kill, hurt or main one of my grandchildren (or another family member) unless I broke a covenant I'd made with the Lord, oh what a hard and sad day that would be!!

The gospel is eternal. No temporal trial should come between me and the keeping of my covenants, no matter the cost. God simply asks me to obey; he will make up for any loss. I am willing to die to protect my family, but I will not break my covenants because of a temporal threat.

JST Matthew 16

25 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.
26 And now for a man to take up his cross, is to deny himself all ungodliness, and every worldly lust, and keep my commandments.
27 Break not my commandments for to save your lives; for whosoever will save his life in this world, shall lose it in the world to come.
28 And whosoever will lose his life in this world, for my sake, shall find it in the world to come.
29 Therefore, forsake the world, and save your souls; for what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
