They that be with us are more than they that be with them

2 Kings 6:
They that be with us are more than they that be with them.

Remember, when things seem overwhelming and too hard to bear, unseen help is there even if you can't see or feel it yet. All you need to do is take the next step in the direction you feel is right. Don't worry about the past (you can't change it), or about the future and the things you can't control. Keep your focus on the Savior as you take that next step forward. Step away from the shadows, toward the light.

Conrad Dunn's Dad printed this scripture out and slipped it into his son's pocket as he was leaving on his mission. President Dunn still has that paper, tucked into his scriptures.
