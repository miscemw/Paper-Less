# Minimalism

**Having less stuff gives you more clarity and more freedom**. *(A thought from [this post](https://sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/) linked to by Jamie Rubin's [Reading for the Week](https://jamierubin.net/2022/04/09/reading-for-the-week-of-4-3-2022/).*

Minimalism doesn't inherently mean sterile or stark—although it could, if that's what makes you happy. 

To me it means having just enough of what you need combined with what you love to be content, and no more. It means simplicity, beauty, and an ordered warmth that isn't too hung up on itself. 

It means having a mindset that continually seeks to [[Simplify]] the complexities of both the physical and the intangible world. Not to dumb anything down, but to distill it to its essence; keeping what truly matters and letting the rest float away. Evicting it if necessary.

>Minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts us from it.
—Joshua Becker

I'd like to find a word to replace "Minimalism". One that reflects my thoughts more accurately. [[Essentialism]] works for some people, but my mind reads that as only keeping what you *need* need, foregoing the non-functional stuff you want to keep just because having it around makes you feel good.

In her book [[Decluttering at the Speed of Life]], Dana White suggested [[Simplism]]. It's closer to what I'm thinking of but not quite there yet. [[Campbell, Sarah|Sarah]] has studied this book closely, and has been a great help to me on my simplifying journey.
