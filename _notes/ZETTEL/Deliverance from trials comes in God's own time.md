Deliverance from trials comes in God's own time

Wherever we are, whatever we are going through, God is in that place even if we know it not. Genesis 28:16

Joseph likely prayed for deliverance when he was in the pit, then accosted by Potiphar's wife in the palace, and then again in the prison. 
God allowed him to have those experiences so he would be ready for the work he had for him to do.

When we must go through a wilderness, God always provides a well. Genesis 21:19
