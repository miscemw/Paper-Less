Scriptures can be accurately interpreted only by the Spirit.

Holy people, appointed by God, can interpret scriptural prophecy.
2 Peter 1:20–21
Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

We can receive insight—revealed by the spirit— into how scriptures apply to us. These insights are often unique applications of truth for our personal benefit, not for preaching publically.
