title: The Post-it Note productivity system
---

One task per Post-it note, written as you think of them. Stick them to a board, or a wall near your working area. Each note goes into one of three sections:
1. Doing
2. Backlog
3. Done

Put the note on your laptop and work on that, *and only that*. 

When it's done, add it to your pile of completed tasks. Pick another task from your pile of tasks that need doing.
