# INDEX - Plain Text Productivity Digest
## About
This is the first in a series of posts documenting my plain text, paper-less journey. It’s raw, it’s real, and—hopefully—relevant.

You can expect each post to be a 5-minute or less summary of what I’ve read, learned, and implemented since the last episode.
