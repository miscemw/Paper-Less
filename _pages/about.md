# About Me
I've been a graphic designer and educational publisher for more than 30 years, and I teach part-time. 

Planning is my passion; I’ve been consuming and creating planners for as long as I can remember and I’m loving the shift from paper to paperless! Actually that should read paper, less. You won't see me giving up my notebook and pen any time soon.

I'm one of the founders of [E&R Publications](https://eandrpublications.com.au/), a company that produces productivity and curriculum resources for teachers. You can also find our exclusively digital products on [Teachers Pay Teachers](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/E-And-R-Publications).

This year I'm working on a few projects.
- An interactive PDF planner for regular people (not just teachers)
- Writing regularly on Medium
- Learning how Twitter works, and figuring out if it's for me
- Exploring plain text productivity

I built this digital garden on the free, open-source template [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). I create and edit Markdown files for this site in [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

If you want to build your own, the easiest way to get started is to read this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).
